    <h1>About me</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Boyd Hoogkamer, I am 18 years old and I study at Mediacollege Amsterdam.<br>
       The reason why I started this education is because I'm very interested in coding and<br>
       development. There is a lot to achieve by being a good developer, so I'm really<br>
       looking forward to improve in development. I really seek more knowledge in this job. <br>
